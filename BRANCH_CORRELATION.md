# Branch Correlation Documentation

## Problem
The `main` and `develop` branches had completely divergent histories with no common ancestor:
- **main**: Started with commit `a3e4a7b` (Initial commit by Rodrigo) - contained basic setup files
- **develop**: Started with commit `a7efa0f` (Initial commit by Daniel) - contained full React application

This made it impossible to merge the branches using standard Git merge operations.

## Solution
A merge commit was created that correlates both branch histories using the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag. This merge commit now serves as a common point between the two branches.

### Merge Details
- **Merge Commit**: `a8121bd` - "Merge develop into main to correlate branches"
- **Strategy**: Merged `develop` into a branch based on `main`
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Used develop's `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `README.md` (React app configuration)
  - Kept main's `LICENSE` file (GPLv3)
  - Kept main's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (CI/CD workflow)
  - Preserved main's `eslint.config.mjs`

### Current State
The working branch `copilot/fix-411e916d-2147-47b3-8248-4282e326af2c` now contains:
- ✅ Complete React application from develop (whiteboard, comments, user management)
- ✅ LICENSE and CI/CD workflow from main
- ✅ Proper .gitignore and Docker configuration
- ✅ Both branch histories merged

## How to Proceed

### Option 1: Update main branch (Recommended)
To enable future merges, you should update the `main` branch to include this correlation:

```bash
# This should be done by someone with push access to main
git checkout main
git merge copilot/fix-411e916d-2147-47b3-8248-4282e326af2c
git push origin main
```

After this, you can merge between main and develop normally.

### Option 2: Update develop branch
Alternatively, you could merge this into develop:

```bash
# This should be done by someone with push access to develop
git checkout develop
git merge copilot/fix-411e916d-2147-47b3-8248-4282e326af2c
git push origin develop
```

### Option 3: Use this branch as the new baseline
Create a new branch from this correlation point to serve as either the new main or develop.

## Future Merges
Once either main or develop includes the correlation commit (`a8121bd`), standard Git merges will work between the branches:

```bash
# Example: Merge develop into main
git checkout main
git merge develop
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main

# Example: Merge main into develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin develop
```

## Verification
To verify that branches share history, use:
```bash
git merge-base main develop
```

If this returns a commit hash, the branches are properly correlated.
